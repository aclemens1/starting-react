# Pokemon App

Barebones React Pokemon Index

This is a test where I challenge myself to use MUI only for a basic React app. No CSS and no HTML tags are allowed.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
### `npm test`
### `npm run build`
### `npm run eject`
### `npm run predeploy`
### `npm run deploy`
